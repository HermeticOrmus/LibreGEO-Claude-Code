# GEO Platform Optimizer

Only **11% of domains** are cited by BOTH ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews for the same query. Each AI search platform uses different indexes, ranking logic, and source preferences. Platform-specific optimization is foundational to any serious GEO strategy.

## How to Use

1. Collect target URL and the site's primary topic/industry
2. Open `platforms.md` (this skill directory) — it holds the 5 platform sections, each with `How X Selects Sources` rules + 10-item optimization checklist + 0-100 scoring rubric
3. Run each platform's checklist against the site
4. Score each platform on its rubric (0-100)
5. Generate `GEO-PLATFORM-OPTIMIZATION.md` using the output template below

## Platforms Covered

Full rules + checklists + rubrics live in `platforms.md`:

1. **Google AI Overviews (AIO)** — top-10 organic gateway, question-headed Q&A, tables/lists, FAQ pattern
2. **ChatGPT Web Search** — Bing-indexed, Wikipedia/Wikidata entity-driven, authoritative & long-form
3. **Perplexity AI** — Reddit-heavy, community validation, freshness, original research
4. **Google Gemini** — Google ecosystem (YouTube, GBP, Knowledge Graph, Schema.org), multi-modal
5. **Bing Copilot** — Bing WMT + IndexNow, LinkedIn/GitHub/Microsoft Learn, fast load

Do NOT paraphrase or substitute the per-platform rules — read them verbatim from `platforms.md` before scoring.
